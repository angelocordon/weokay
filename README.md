# We Okay

For when you just need to hear that youâ€™re doing all right.

## Motivation

My love language must be words of affirmation. Somedays, I just need someone to validate my feelings and tell me that my efforts are well taken and I'm doing all right. Maybe you may need something like that, too? In any case, sometimes, positive words can go along way and I hope this helps someone as much as it helps me.
